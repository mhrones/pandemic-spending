A research project regarding perceived changes in discretionary spending during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The goal of this project was to explore the relationship between perceived changes in discrestionary consumer spending before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, as well how the US Government's economic policies  (Stimulus checks, Unemployment Benefits, etc) affected consumer spending.

The importance lies in gaining insight on the impacts of government policies in times of crisis, and their effectiveness in avoiding a recession in the economy. Findings would help determine what types of economic policies work most effectively to minimize economic turmoil.
